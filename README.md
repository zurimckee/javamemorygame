# javamemorygame
<bold>this cool memory game that i did as my final project for java its green like everything else that i make</bold>
<hr>
:memo: I used java and javafx to create individual cards that were then added to a larger gridpane the gridpane was then added to a borderpane with further functionality for starting a new game, exiting,  navigating between levels etc.
<br>
:memo: animationtimer is used to dictate how long the front side of the card is shown when it's flipped and event handling is used to change between levels, flip cards, 
and for overall button usage. 
<br>
:memo: plus the cards make noise when a match is achieved, and a different noise when there isn't a match. also there's victory music! enjoy!
